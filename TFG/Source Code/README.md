# Cookie-Engine

A simple ECS game engine written in C++ that has been built as a learning proyect.

## Samples
The repository contains the following sample projects:
* **Cookie Survival**: A simple "minigame" implemented in the engine.
* **Cookie Boids**: Simulation of multiple boids.
* **Cookie Physics**: Showcase of the Box2D library integrated in the engine
* **Cookie Game**: Sandbox testing project.

## Building System
The proyect provides **Premake5** build files.
Execute premake5 in the root folder and it will build the engine with all the sample proyects in the **bin** folder on the root directory.
*NOTE: The build system has only been tested to work when building for Visual Studio 2019*
